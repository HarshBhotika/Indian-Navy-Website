The Delhi-class destroyers are guided-missile destroyers of the Indian Navy. 
The development of the ship began as "Project 15" in 1977. The ships were designed indigenously and built by Mazagon Docks Limited (MDL) at a cost of 
Rs 7 Billion each. The Delhi class has both Soviet and Western design influences, incorporating elements of the Sovremenny, Rajput and Kashin-II-class destroyers, 
and the Godavari-class frigate.
The Delhi-class vessels are the third-largest warships to be fully designed and built in India, after the Kolkata-class destroyers and the Shivalik-class frigates. 
They were built at Mazagon Dock Limited in Mumbai. Three ships of this class are in active service.

<h4><u>Rajput Class Destroyer</u></h4>

<br>
The Rajput-class guided-missile destroyers built for the Indian Navy are modified versions of Soviet Kashin-class destroyers. They are also known as Kashin-II class. 
The ships were built in the former Soviet Union after considerable Indian design modifications to the Kashin design. These included the replacement of the helicopter 
pad in the original design with a flight elevator, as well as major changes to the electronics and combat systems. Five units were built for export to India in the 
1980s. All units are currently attached to the Eastern Naval Command.
