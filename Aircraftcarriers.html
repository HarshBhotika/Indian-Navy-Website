INS Vikramaditya (Sanskrit, Vikramaditya meaning "Brave as the Sun") is a modified Kiev-class aircraft carrier which entered into service with the Indian Navy in 2013.
She has been renamed in honour of Vikramaditya, a legendary emperor of Ujjain, India.
Originally built as Baku and commissioned in 1987, the carrier served with the Soviet Navy and later with the Russian Navy (as Admiral Gorshkov) before being 
decommissioned in 1996. The carrier was purchased by India on 20 January 2004 after years of negotiations at a final price of $2.35 billion. The ship successfully 
completed her sea trials in July 2013 and aviation trials in September 2013.
She was commissioned on 16 November 2013 at a ceremony held at Severodvinsk, Russia. On 14 June 2014, the Prime Minister of India formally inducted INS Vikramaditya 
into the Indian Navy and dedicated her to the nation.

<br>
INS Viraat (Sanskrit: Virata meaning Giant) was a Centaur-class aircraft carrier of the Indian Navy. INS Viraat was the flagship of the Indian Navy before 
INS Vikramaditya was commissioned in 2013. The last British-built ship serving with the Indian Navy, she was the oldest aircraft carrier in service in the world. 
The ship was completed and commissioned in 1959 as the Royal Navy's HMS Hermes, and decommissioned in 1984. It was sold to India in 1987. INS Viraat was commissioned 
into the Indian Navy on 12 May 1987, and served for almost 30 years.
In February 2015, the Navy stated that Viraat would be decommissioned the following year. On 23 July 2016, Viraat sailed for the last time under her own power 
from Mumbai to Kochi, where she was dry-docked and prepared for decommissioning. She was towed out of Kochi on 23 October, returning to Mumbai on 28 October, 
where she was laid up. Viraat was formally decommissioned on 6 March 2017. Her ultimate fate is currently undetermined.
