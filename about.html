<h3><u>About Indian navy</u></h3>
<br>
The Indian Navy  is the naval branch of the armed forces of India.
The Indian Navy can trace its lineage back to the Royal Indian Navy, however the modern navy as it is known today was not officially created until 1947 after independence was gained from the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
Though the primary objective of the navy is to secure the nation's maritime borders, India also uses its navy to enhance its international relations through joint exercises, port visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster relief. 
</p>
<p>
The Indian Navy has a strength of 58,350 personnel and a large operational fleet consisting of; an aircraft carrier, an amphibious transport dock, eight guided missile destroyers, 15 frigates, one nuclear attack submarine, 13 conventional submarines, 24 corvettes, 30 patrol vessels, 7 mine countermeasure vessels and various auxiliary ships.
</p>
<h4><u>Current role</u></h4>
Currently the principal roles of Indian Navy are:
<ul>
<li>In conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace.</li>
<li>Project influence in India's maritime area of interest, to further the nation's political, economic and security objectives</li>
<li>In co-operation with the Indian Coast Guard, ensure good order and stability in India's maritime zones of responsibility.</li>
<li>Provide maritime assistance (including disaster relief) in India's maritime neighbourhood.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<h4><u>Indian Navy Ships</u></h4>
The names of all in service ships (and Naval Bases) of the Indian Navy are prefixed with the letters INS, designating Indian Naval Ship or Indian Navy Station.
The Indian Navy presently has one aircraft carrier in active service, the INS Viraat. The carrier is planned for decommissioning after the induction of the first domestically built Vikrant class aircraft carrier.
</p>
<p>
The Indian Navy will also commission the Russian-built INS Vikramaditya.
The navy currently operates three Delhi and five Rajput class guided-missile destroyers.
</p>
<p>
In addition to destroyers, the navy operates several classes of frigates such as three Shivalik and five Talwar class frigates.
Smaller littoral zone combatants in service are in the form of corvettes, of which, the Indian Navy operates the Kora, Khukri, Veer and Abhay classes corvettes.
<p>
Hence it proves that indian navy has large no of various types of Ships.
